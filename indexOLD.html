        <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,<br>
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage,<br>
             anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.<br>
              [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.<br>

            In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
