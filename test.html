        <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of<br> 
            a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients<br>
             (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked <br>
             pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

            In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p></h2>
